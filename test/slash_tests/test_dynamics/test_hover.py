# Placeholder for quadrotor hover stability tests
#
# This file will contain tests that verify the quadrotor's ability to:
# - Reach and maintain stable hover at specified altitudes
# - Respond appropriately to hover commands
# - Maintain position within acceptable tolerances
# 
# Tests will use the Slash framework to interact with the ROS 2 simulator
# and verify dynamic stability behavior.
#
# No implementation yet - awaiting architecture and requirements finalization.
