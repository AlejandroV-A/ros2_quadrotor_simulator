## Next Steps

To move forward with the project development, our immediate tasks are:

1. **Create requirements directory structure** - Set up the framework for organizing and documenting requirements
2. **Draft initial high-level requirements** - Document core requirements across all categories
3. **Define core interfaces** - Establish clear boundaries and communication protocols between components
4. **Begin environment setup** - Configure development tools and initial framework
