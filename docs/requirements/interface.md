# Interface Requirements

This document contains the interface requirements for the ROS 2 Quadrotor Simulator project. Interface requirements describe how the system communicates with external components.

## ROS 2 Interfaces

### REQ-IR-101: ROS 2 Topic Structure

**Description:** The simulator must expose the same ROS 2 topic structure as the real AscTec Hummingbird when used with ROS 2, including all essential topics for state, control, and sensor data.

**Rationale:** Ensures drop-in compatibility for testing applications designed for the real hardware.

**Verification Method:** Inspection - Compare topic list with reference implementation.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-102: Message Types

**Description:** The simulator must use standard ROS 2 message types where available, and define custom message types only when necessary.

**Rationale:** Standard message types improve interoperability with existing ROS 2 tools and packages.

**Verification Method:** Inspection - Review message type definitions.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-103: Service Interfaces

**Description:** The simulator must provide ROS 2 service interfaces for all non-continuous interactions, such as mode changes, parameter updates, and simulator control.

**Rationale:** Services are the appropriate mechanism for request-response interactions.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify all specified services function correctly.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-104: Action Interfaces

**Description:** The simulator must provide ROS 2 action interfaces for all long-running tasks, such as trajectory following, that require feedback during execution.

**Rationale:** Actions are the appropriate mechanism for long-running tasks with feedback.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify all specified actions function correctly.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Hardware Interfaces

### REQ-IR-201: Serial Interface Emulation

**Description:** The simulator must emulate the serial interface used by the real AscTec Hummingbird for communication with external systems.

**Rationale:** Serial communication is commonly used to interface with the real hardware.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify that external systems can communicate with the simulator via the emulated serial interface.

**Priority:** Could-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-202: External Sensor Interfaces

**Description:** The simulator must provide interfaces for integrating external sensor simulations (e.g., cameras, LiDAR).

**Rationale:** Extensibility for different sensor configurations is important for diverse use cases.

**Verification Method:** Demonstration - Demonstrate integration of sample external sensors.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

## User Interfaces

### REQ-IR-301: Command Line Interface

**Description:** The simulator must provide a comprehensive command line interface for controlling all simulator functions.

**Rationale:** CLI support is essential for scripting and automation.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify all functions are accessible via CLI.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-302: Configuration Files

**Description:** The simulator must support YAML-based configuration files for all simulator parameters.

**Rationale:** Configuration files allow saving and reusing simulator setups.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify simulator can be configured via YAML files.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-303: Visualization Interface

**Description:** The simulator must provide an RViz-based visualization interface for observing the quadrotor's state and environment.

**Rationale:** Visualization is essential for debugging and demonstration.

**Verification Method:** Demonstration - Show visualization capabilities.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Programming Interfaces

### REQ-IR-401: C API

**Description:** The simulator must provide a C API for direct integration with embedded code developed for the AscTec Hummingbird.

**Rationale:** C is the language used in the real hardware's firmware.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify the API functions correctly with sample embedded code.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-402: Python API

**Description:** The simulator must provide a Python API for higher-level control and integration.

**Rationale:** Python is commonly used for rapid prototyping and algorithm development.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify the API functions correctly with sample Python code.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-403: Plugin Interface

**Description:** The simulator must provide a plugin interface for extending functionality without modifying the core codebase.

**Rationale:** Plugins allow customization and extension without core code changes.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify plugin mechanism works with sample plugins.

**Priority:** Could-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Data Interfaces

### REQ-IR-501: Logging Interface

**Description:** The simulator must provide a configurable logging interface that can output to files, the console, and ROS 2 logging system.

**Rationale:** Flexible logging is essential for debugging and analysis.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify logs are correctly output to all configured destinations.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-IR-502: Data Export

**Description:** The simulator must support exporting simulation data in common formats (CSV, rosbag) for analysis.

**Rationale:** Data export enables post-simulation analysis and visualization.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify data can be exported and used in analysis tools.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed
