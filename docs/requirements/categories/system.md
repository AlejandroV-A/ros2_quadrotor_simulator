# System Requirements

This document contains the system requirements for the ROS 2 Quadrotor Simulator project. System requirements describe technical constraints and integration points.

## Hardware and Software Environment

### REQ-SR-101: System Requirements

**Description:** The simulator must run on systems with at least 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, and a dedicated graphics card compatible with OpenGL 4.0+.

**Rationale:** These specifications ensure smooth real-time simulation and visualization.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify performance on minimum specification hardware.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-102: ROS 2 Dependency

**Description:** The simulator must be compatible with ROS 2 Humble and use its communication middleware.

**Rationale:** ROS 2 provides the messaging infrastructure needed for component communication.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify all functionality works with ROS 2 Humble.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-103: C/C++ Standards

**Description:** C code must comply with C11 standard and C++ code must comply with C++17 standard.

**Rationale:** Standardization ensures portability and maintainability.

**Verification Method:** Static analysis - Verify code complies with standards.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-104: Python Compatibility

**Description:** Python components must be compatible with Python 3.8+ and maintain backward compatibility.

**Rationale:** Python 3.8 is widely available and supported in target environments.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify functionality with Python 3.8+.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Build and Deployment

### REQ-SR-201: Build System

**Description:** The project must use colcon as its build system and provide CMake configuration for all C/C++ components.

**Rationale:** Colcon is the standard build system for ROS 2 projects.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify build works with colcon.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-202: Installation

**Description:** The simulator must provide an installation procedure that requires no manual dependency resolution.

**Rationale:** Easy installation improves user experience and adoption.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify clean installation on a fresh system.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-203: Continuous Integration

**Description:** The codebase must support continuous integration through GitHub Actions with automated testing.

**Rationale:** CI ensures code quality and prevents regressions.

**Verification Method:** Demonstration - Show CI workflow in action.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Security and Safety

### REQ-SR-301: Input Validation

**Description:** The simulator must validate all external inputs (parameters, command inputs, data files) to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.

**Rationale:** Input validation improves stability and security.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify system handles invalid inputs gracefully.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-302: Resource Isolation

**Description:** The simulator must properly isolate its resources from the rest of the system to prevent unintended interactions.

**Rationale:** Resource isolation prevents conflicts with other applications.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify simulator doesn't interfere with other processes.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

## Performance Constraints

### REQ-SR-401: Memory Usage

**Description:** The simulator must not exceed 4GB of RAM usage during normal operation.

**Rationale:** Excessive memory usage can degrade system performance.

**Verification Method:** Test - Monitor memory usage during various operations.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-402: CPU Utilization

**Description:** The simulator must efficiently use available CPU resources without excessive thread creation or spinning.

**Rationale:** Efficient CPU usage ensures good performance on a variety of systems.

**Verification Method:** Test - Monitor CPU usage during various operations.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

## External Interfaces

### REQ-SR-501: External APIs

**Description:** The simulator must provide well-documented APIs for external systems to interact with it programmatically.

**Rationale:** APIs enable integration with other software systems.

**Verification Method:** Inspection - Review API documentation and interfaces.

**Priority:** Should-have

**Status:** Proposed

### REQ-SR-502: Data Import/Export

**Description:** The simulator must support standard data formats (CSV, YAML, JSON) for configuration and data export.

**Rationale:** Standard formats improve interoperability with other tools.

**Verification Method:** Test - Verify import/export functionality works with specified formats.

**Priority:** Must-have

**Status:** Proposed
