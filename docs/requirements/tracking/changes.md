- Implementation: Detailed implementation specification added
- Milestone: Major project milestone or phase completion

## Impact Analysis
For each change, analyze and document:
1. Impact on dependent requirements
2. Impact on existing implementation
3. Impact on tests
4. Required updates to documentation

### 2025-04-27 INT-301 and REQ-FR-102 Modification
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: None significantly impacted as the core real-time functionality remains
2. Implementation: Simplifies real-time management implementation by removing faster-than-real-time complexity
3. Tests: Will need to verify real-time precision but removes need for faster-than-real-time test cases
4. Documentation: Updated in COPILOT.md to reflect revised time management capabilities

### 2025-04-27 REQ-IR-* Implementation
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: Affects implementation details of all functional requirements that interact with these interfaces
2. Implementation: Provides concrete interface definitions for all major system components
3. Tests: Test cases will need to verify interface compliance
4. Documentation: Created new CORE_INTERFACES.md document with detailed specifications

### 2025-04-27 Phase 1.1 Milestone
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: All requirements now have proper documentation and tracking
2. Implementation: Ready to begin development environment setup
3. Tests: Testing strategy defined and documented
4. Documentation: All foundation documents completed and properly cross-referenced
