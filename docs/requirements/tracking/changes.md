## Impact Analysis
For each change, analyze and document:
1. Impact on dependent requirements
2. Impact on existing implementation
3. Impact on tests
4. Required updates to documentation

### 2025-05-08 Docker Development Environment Implementation
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: Successfully implements development environment requirements, enabling all subsequent implementation tasks
2. Implementation: Provides verified Docker-based development environment with ROS 2 Humble
3. Tests: Development environment supports all planned testing frameworks (Google Test, Slash)
4. Documentation: Docker setup validated against DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md instructions

### 2025-04-27 INT-301 and REQ-FR-102 Modification
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: None significantly impacted as the core real-time functionality remains
2. Implementation: Simplifies real-time management implementation by removing faster-than-real-time complexity
3. Tests: Will need to verify real-time precision but removes need for faster-than-real-time test cases
4. Documentation: Updated in COPILOT.md to reflect revised time management capabilities

### 2025-04-27 REQ-IR-* Implementation
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: Affects implementation details of all functional requirements that interact with these interfaces
2. Implementation: Provides concrete interface definitions for all major system components
3. Tests: Test cases will need to verify interface compliance
4. Documentation: Created new CORE_INTERFACES.md document with detailed specifications

### 2025-04-27 Phase 1.1 Milestone
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: All requirements now have proper documentation and tracking
2. Implementation: Ready to begin development environment setup
3. Tests: Testing strategy defined and documented
4. Documentation: All foundation documents completed and properly cross-referenced

### 2025-04-27 Development Environment Setup Implementation
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: Implements REQ-SR-101, REQ-SR-102, REQ-SR-103, REQ-SR-104, REQ-NFR-401
2. Implementation: Provides complete development environment configuration
3. Tests: Enables automated testing setup with Google Test and Slash
4. Documentation: Added DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md with comprehensive setup instructions
