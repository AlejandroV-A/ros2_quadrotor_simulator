### 2025-04-27 INT-301 and REQ-FR-102 Modification
**Impact Analysis**:
1. Dependent Requirements: None significantly impacted as the core real-time functionality remains
2. Implementation: Simplifies real-time management implementation by removing faster-than-real-time complexity
3. Tests: Will need to verify real-time precision but removes need for faster-than-real-time test cases
4. Documentation: Updated in COPILOT.md to reflect revised time management capabilities
