# Requirements Management Strategy

This document outlines how requirements will be managed, tracked, and maintained in the ROS 2 Quadrotor Simulator project.

## Requirements Philosophy

For this project, we're adopting a "living requirements" approach where requirements are:
1. Stored directly in the repository alongside the code
2. Version controlled with the same tools as the code
3. Updated and refined as the project evolves
4. Traceable to implementations and tests

## Requirements Structure

Requirements will be organized into the following categories:

1. **Functional Requirements (FR)**: What the system should do
   - Simulation capabilities
   - Interface specifications
   - Behavioral requirements

2. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**: Quality attributes
   - Performance (real-time operation)
   - Accuracy of simulation
   - Usability
   - Maintainability

3. **System Requirements (SR)**: Technical constraints
   - Platform compatibility
   - ROS 2 integration
   - Hardware specifications

4. **Interface Requirements (IR)**: Communication specifications
   - ROS topics/services/actions
   - Data formats
   - External system interfaces

## Requirements Storage

Requirements will be stored in a structured format in the repository:

1. **Main Requirements Document**:
   - `/docs/requirements/requirements.md`: Master list of all requirements

2. **Category-Specific Requirements**:
   - `/docs/requirements/functional.md`: Functional requirements
   - `/docs/requirements/non-functional.md`: Non-functional requirements
   - `/docs/requirements/system.md`: System requirements
   - `/docs/requirements/interface.md`: Interface requirements

3. **Format**:
   Each requirement will follow this format:
   ```
   REQ-[Category]-[Number]: [Short Title]
   
   Description: [Detailed description]
   Rationale: [Why this requirement exists]
   Verification Method: [How to verify this requirement is met]
   Priority: [Must-have | Should-have | Could-have | Won't-have]
   Status: [Proposed | Approved | Implemented | Verified | Deferred]
   ```

## Requirements Traceability

To maintain traceability between requirements, code, and tests:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Each requirement will have a corresponding GitHub issue
   - Label: `requirement`
   - Additional labels for category: `functional`, `non-functional`, etc.

2. **Code Implementation**: 
   - Source code will reference requirement IDs in comments
   - Example: `// Implements REQ-FR-101: Accurate Gyroscope Simulation`

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Tests will reference the requirements they verify
   - Example: `// Verifies REQ-FR-101, REQ-NFR-203`

4. **Pull Requests**:
   - Will reference the requirement issue(s) they implement
   - Will close requirement issues when complete

## Requirements Management Process

1. **Creation**:
   - Requirements can be proposed by any team member
   - Must be discussed and reviewed before approval
   - Use pull requests for adding new requirements

2. **Review**:
   - Requirements are reviewed during regular meetings
   - Feedback collected via GitHub PR comments
   - Must be approved by at least one other team member

3. **Changes**:
   - Changes to existing requirements must be tracked and justified
   - Version history maintained through Git
   - Major changes may require re-verification

4. **Prioritization**:
   - MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have)
   - Priority can change based on project progress and feedback

## Requirements Verification

Each requirement must specify its verification method:

1. **Inspection**: Manual review of the design/code
2. **Analysis**: Theoretical or modeling verification
3. **Demonstration**: Showing the capability works
4. **Test**: Specific tests that verify the requirement

## Tooling

We'll use the following tools to manage requirements:

1. **GitHub Issues & Projects**: Tracking requirement status
2. **Pull Requests**: Reviewing and approving requirements
3. **Markdown**: Documenting requirements
4. **CI/CD**: Automated verification where possible

## Current Requirements Status

As of now, we're in the initial requirements gathering phase. The next steps are:

1. Create the requirements directory structure
2. Draft initial high-level requirements
3. Begin the review process
4. Establish priorities for implementation
